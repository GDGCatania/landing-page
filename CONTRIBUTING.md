# Contributing to GDG Catania's Landing Page
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Gitlab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code is stable and linted.
3. Issue that pull request!

## We Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. 

It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can try running `yarn lint` for style unification.
